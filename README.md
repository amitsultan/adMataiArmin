## General Introduction

In our project "evacuation bottleneck" we are modeling the escape dynamics in a panic situation in a single room.
As many disasters in the past years have shown, we still do not fully understand crowd behavior especially in panic situations. An example would be the Love Parade disaster in 2010 in Duisburg or the Madrid incident in 2012, where five girls were killed.
With our model we want to give an insight in such evacuation situations and try to establish a connection between the number of barriers in the room and casualties.

## The Model

We create different rooms with a variation of additional barriers inside.
By running the simulation repeatedly we hope to find a relationship between the amount of barriers we added, their position and the number of casualties.

Since our model is a highly simplified version of reality, the application to real life scenarios needs to be further tested. Alone the reduction to two-dimensions is significant.


## Fundamental Questions
To what extent are additional barriers responsible for casualties in an evacuation scenario?
Do the position of the barriers in the room matter?

## Expected Results
Additional barriers increase the number of casualties, because they narrow the space and people will be closer to each other. Also the position should be of great significands. Two barriers getting more and more narrow, should increase the forces experience by the people.

There are many extensions to our model. It is always possible to extend the scale of the rooms maybe even simulate an evacuation of a multifloor building.
Also adding random behavior would increase the connection to real life events.

## Research Methods
We are using a social force model.

## Results
The simulations are uploaded in the youtube playlist:

## Other
There are no external datasets used.

# Reproducibility

## Light test
We assume you have python 3.6 (or higher) installed.


### Debian/Ubuntu:

If not allready installed, install pip by running the command 

"sudo apt-get install python3-pip"

in your terminal.

Install the python packages numpy, pygame, scipy,  progress.bar, sys, matplotlib by
running the following commands in your terminal:

"sudo pip install numpy"

"sudo pip install scipy"

"sudo -m pip install -U pygame --user"

"sudo pip install progressbar2"

"sudo -m pip install -U matplotlib"

Open running_code.py in your editor and read the comments.
Now run the code by running the following command:

"python3 PATH_TO_FOLDER/evacuation-bottleneck-master/code/code_python/running_code.py"

It should not run longer than two minutes. Now there should pop up a Window which shows you three graphs in different colors.
If you close this Window, a new one will pop up and show the simulation in "real time".
It is possible, that there are bugs in the simulation. This is because you used leap_frog 
as the integration methode. Leap_frog is inaccurate, but is fast enough for a normal laptop.

If you want you can now change some variables and look at the result.


### Windows:

If you have python 3.6 (or higher) installed, pip should allready be installed too.
If not, visit: "https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki/Python-&-pip-Windows-installation"
Make sure you have the "Add python 3.6 to PATH" option selected.

Install the python packages numpy, pygame, scipy,  progress.bar, sys, matplotlib
by running the following commands in your terminal:

"pip install numpy"

"pip install scipy"

"python -m pip install -U pygame --user"

"pip install progressbar2"

"python -m pip install -U matplotlib"

Open running_code.py in your editor and read the comments.
Now run the code by running the following command:

"python PATH_TO_FOLDER\evacuation-bottleneck-master\code\code_python\running_code.py"

It should not run longer than two minutes. Now there should pop up a Window which shows you three graphs in different colors.

### Run the code in Euler

Given that our codes are too heavy for standard laptop computers, it is
necessary to send them to a more powerful cluster (in our case the EULER-
Cluster). The codes are stored in code/code_euler. In order to send them, please
use scp to send a copy of Euler_v9. pyto your personal space in the cluster. In 
a secure shell, import the necessary modules (python and gcc) and use the batch
submit system. More instructions for the use of the cluster is given on
https://scicomp.ethz.ch/wiki/Getting_started_with_clusters. For a simulation with
40 automata for 200 timesteps a minimum running time of 60 hours is recommended.


For optimal results, please use Euler_v9.py. 

#### Euler_v9.py

requires:   numpy,
            sys


The program initializes a simulation class with the following arguments

Simulation(Number of agents, number of steps, integrator type, type of room)

Integrator types: ode45, leap_frog, leap_frog_v2, exp_euler, exp_midpoint

For accurate results with longest running time use ode45.

Room types: 'square', 'long_room_v2', 'edu_1', 'edu_room'

The code saves three .npy files in the runing directory: y.npy agents.npy 
forces.npy

#### DisplayEuler.py
requires:   numpy,
            sys,
            pygame,
            matplotlib
            
            
Import the .npy files generated from the cluster using scp into the same
directory to where the script is. Run DisplayEuler.py to present the simulations.
